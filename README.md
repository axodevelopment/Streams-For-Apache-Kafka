# Tutorials and information around Streams For Apache Kafka

Tutorials around Streams For Apache Kafka running on OCP

# Overview of RH ACS

In this Repo I want to spend some time covering various types of Kafka setups which include most types of configurations and setups.  Ideally i'll be able to elaborate a bit on pros and cons for different designs and architectures but at the very least give you a step by step on setting up more interesting designs that you may actually use rather then just high level tutorials that don't get you close to an actual prod release.
