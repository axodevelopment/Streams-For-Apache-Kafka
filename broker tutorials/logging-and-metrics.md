# Streams For Apache Kafka - Logging and Metrics

Tutorials around Streams For Apache Kafka running on OCP - How to enable and manage Logging and Metrics

## Overview of tutorial

Being able to enable debug mode and view metrics are important aspects to long term management of a cluster.  Also to be able to alert based upon metrics exported is valuable as well.  In this tutorial we will talk about how to configure and view these items.

## Pre requisites

Lets start with deploying the basic no frills kafka cluster that includes two clusters, (resize if you want), one that has kraft, the other zookeeperbased.

First lets createa  project

```bash
oc new-project kafka-tutorial-east
oc new-project kafka-tutorial-kraft-east
```

Here we will do our testinging out of `kafka-tutorial-east`

Now we will want to deploy two yaml files that are in the ./ref folder.

```bash
oc apply -f tutorial-cluster-east-v1.yaml

oc apply -f tutorial-cluster-east-zk-v1.yaml
```

Before continuing any further please wait for all pods to be created.

```bash

oc get pods -w
```



This process will take some time, we will need to create zookeeper instances, operator instances, brokers with zookeeper and brokers with kraft.

`WARNING` if you see no activity in the `oc get pods -w` you either have already completed this step or have some yaml issue take note of a common one for kraft below

To deploy using kraft not only do you need the Kafka resource but you also need to enable nodepool resource you can see the operator will likely fail (current version it does) here is how you can tell in the logs.

Presently the operator is still called amq-streams-cluster-operator that is subject to change in future releases.

```bash
oc get pods -n openshift-operators | grep streams

oc logs amq-streams-cluster-operator-v2.9.0-0-b79d9649-ntr9l -n openshift-operators
```

Here you will see some reconciliation failure if KRaft is enabled and no NodePools are deployed.  Something like the following.

```bash
WARN  AbstractOperator:566 - Reconciliation #99(timer) Kafka(kafka-tutorial-kraft-east/my-cluster-kraft): Failed to reconcile
io.strimzi.operator.common.InvalidConfigurationException: KRaft can only be used with a Kafka cluster that uses KafkaNodePool resources.
```

If you get this just note what I mentioned above when a KRaft based Kafka cluster is deployed it will search for the configuration from a KafkaNodePool.  I'll explain this resource in another tutorial, but to keep it simple, it is used by the KRaft broker to configure and setup the broker with those configurations in the nodepool.

```bash
oc apply -f tutorial-nodepool-east-v1.yaml

oc apply -f tutorial-cluster-east-v1.yaml
```

If you want to follow along what steps are happening

```bash
oc logs amq-streams-cluster-operator-v2.9.0-0-b79d9649-ntr9l -n openshift-operators --follow
```

To know when your cluster is complete, for KRaft enabled kafka with the configured i have in this tutorial you should end up with something along the lines of:

```bash
oc get pods -w

NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-cluster-kraft-cruise-control-5778f6468-ckqpl     1/1     Running   0          30s
my-cluster-kraft-entity-operator-545ccd488d-ldvz6   2/2     Running   0          52s
my-cluster-kraft-kafka-np-0                         1/1     Running   0          78s
my-cluster-kraft-kafka-np-1                         1/1     Running   0          78s
my-cluster-kraft-kafka-np-2                         1/1     Running   0          78s
```

For a zookeeper setup you should end up with something like:

```bash
oc get pods -n kafka-tutorial-east
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-cluster-zk-cruise-control-5d7dcbd84f-9txf7    1/1     Running   0          28m
my-cluster-zk-entity-operator-769d59764d-7bc7m   2/2     Running   0          28m
my-cluster-zk-kafka-0                            1/1     Running   0          29m
my-cluster-zk-kafka-1                            1/1     Running   0          29m
my-cluster-zk-kafka-2                            1/1     Running   0          29m
my-cluster-zk-zookeeper-0                        1/1     Running   0          30m
my-cluster-zk-zookeeper-1                        1/1     Running   0          30m
my-cluster-zk-zookeeper-2                        1/1     Running   0          30m
```
